# DinoVoteRewards
DinoVoteRewards spigot plugin.
Spigot link: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dinovoterewards-1-8-x-1-16-x.80534/

Did you ever wanted to reward your players for voting the server ?
Well, this plugin is for you. You can send commands (like giving some items, money, crates, etc) and broadcast a message when someone votes.

Fully configurable, you can add as many commands as you want, change all the plugin messages, etc.


<b>Dependencies:</b>
<br />
<b>Votifier/NuVotifier</b>
I recomend to install the latest NuVotifier version from here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nuvotifier.13449/
<br />
<b>PlaceHolderAPI<b>
Latest version from spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/
Only if you want to use the placeholders to show the number of votes in a scoreboard or just to make a leaderboard using leaderheads.

If you don't install Votifier or NuVotifier, the plugin won't work !
